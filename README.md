        - buttons in a row: 
            - food log, 
            - pt log, 
            - weight log
    - a card that spans the whole page:
        - square buttons, maybe 3x3 (steal from instagram):
            - {projectName}
            - when i click this button, redirect me to a new route and component
                - upon loading the subsequent component (should be a projectSchema) do an api call for that project's info

- templates/views:
    - 
    - each project

    - get one project
